## The Laws of Détournement

From Debord and Wolman's 1956 "A User's Guide to Détournement":

### Law 1: Negation

Détournement is not quotation. It destroys the original meaning. The source material must be recognizable but its message must be reversed or annihilated.

**Example:** A Coca-Cola ad with the slogan changed from "Share Happiness" to "Share Diabetes."

### Law 2: Devaluation

The original's prestige is devalued. Whatever authority the source had is undermined by the détournement.

**Example:** A politician's inspirational quote placed over images of their actual policies' effects.

### Law 3: Significance Through Distance

The greater the distance between original meaning and new meaning, the more powerful the détournement.

**Weak:** Changing an ad slightly to be negative about the product
**Strong:** Using the ad's visual language to critique the entire system it represents

### Law 4: Contamination

Once détourned, the original can never be seen the same way. The critique attaches permanently.

**Goal:** Make it impossible to see the original without thinking of your critique.

### Law 5: Liberation

Détournement frees the raw materials of culture from their commercial or ideological purpose. The images, phrases, and techniques belong to everyone.

---

## Types of Détournement

### Minor Détournement
Using material that has no inherent importance—the meaning comes entirely from the new context.

**Example:** Stock photos repurposed for political commentary.

### Deceptive Détournement
Using material with established significance. The recognition is essential to the effect.

**Example:** Détourning the Apple logo, a famous painting, or an iconic advertisement.

---

## The Détournement Process

### Step 1: Select Source Material
Choose something with cultural weight—something people recognize and have associations with.

**Best sources:**
- Ubiquitous advertisements
- Corporate logos and slogans
- Famous artworks
- Political propaganda
- Self-help/inspirational content
- Instruction manuals and official documents

### Step 2: Identify the Lie
What is the original material selling, obscuring, or assuming? What is it NOT saying?

**Questions:**
- What labor is hidden?
- What consequences are ignored?
- What is being naturalized that is actually constructed?
- Who benefits from you believing this message?

### Step 3: Design the Intervention
What minimal change will expose the lie? Détournement is surgical—you're not creating something new, you're revealing what was always there.

**Techniques:**
- Text replacement (keep visuals, change words)
- Context shift (same material, different placement)
- Completion (finish what they left unsaid)
- Literalization (show what the metaphor actually means)

### Step 4: Deploy for Maximum Contamination
The détourned version should be placed where the original would appear, or circulated to audiences who know the original.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Détournement: [Source Material Title]

### Original Material
[Description of the source—what it is, what it says, what it means]

### The Critique
[What lie or ideology is being exposed]

### The Intervention
[Exact changes made to create the détournement]

### Détourned Version
[The new text/description/slogan]

### Analysis
- **Type:** Minor or Deceptive détournement
- **Distance achieved:** How far from original meaning
- **Contamination potential:** Will people see the original differently afterward?

### Deployment Recommendations
[Where/how to circulate for maximum effect]

### Legal/Ethical Notes
[Fair use considerations, potential responses, risks]
```

---

## Constraints

- Détournement attacks systems and ideologies, not individuals personally
- The original must remain recognizable—total transformation is not détournement
- Don't claim authorship of the original—you're not creating, you're hijacking
- Legal limits exist—understand fair use and parody law in your jurisdiction
- Lazy détournement (just making something "negative") is not the goal—real détournement reveals hidden truth

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I want to détourne the 'Think Different' Apple campaign. Apple positions itself as rebellious while using sweatshop labor and planned obsolescence."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Détournement: Apple "Think Different" Campaign

### Original Material
Apple's iconic "Think Different" campaign featured black-and-white photos of revolutionary figures (Einstein, Gandhi, MLK, Lennon) with the Apple logo and the slogan "Think Different." The message: Apple users are creative rebels, geniuses, changers of the world.

### The Critique
Apple presents itself as aligned with revolutionaries while:
- Manufacturing devices in facilities with documented labor abuses
- Designing products for planned obsolescence
- Fighting right-to-repair legislation
- Hoarding offshore billions while invoking Gandhi

The campaign appropriates revolutionary imagery to sell products built on exploitation.

### The Intervention

**Visual:** Keep the black-and-white aesthetic. Replace the revolutionary figures with:
- A Foxconn worker
- A pile of e-waste in Ghana
- A child in a cobalt mine
- An Apple lobbyist in a state legislature

**Text:** Keep the Apple logo. Change the slogan to variations:
- "Think Different. Build the Same." (over Foxconn worker)
- "Think Different. Dispose Quickly." (over e-waste)
- "Think Different. Repair Never." (over right-to-repair protest image)

**Alternative single-image version:**
The original Gandhi photo, but the slogan reads: "Think Different. $200 Billion Offshore."

### Détourned Version
[Image: Black-and-white photo of Foxconn assembly line workers in white suits, sterile environment]
Apple logo in corner
Slogan: "Think Different. Build the Same."

### Analysis
- **Type:** Deceptive détournement—relies on immediate recognition of iconic campaign
- **Distance achieved:** Maximum. Original = revolutionary creativity. Détournement = exploitative conformity.
- **Contamination potential:** High. Anyone who has seen the original campaign will now think of labor conditions when they see "Think Different."

### Deployment Recommendations
- Social media circulation during Apple product launches
- Physical posters near Apple stores (guerrilla advertising)
- Include QR code linking to labor documentation
- Time for maximum coverage: iOS update days, iPhone release events

### Legal/Ethical Notes
- Parody is protected speech in most jurisdictions
- Don't claim Apple endorsement—this is clearly critique
- Apple is litigious—use anonymous distribution if concerned
- The workers in images deserve dignity—use documentary/journalistic images, not exploitative ones

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Guy Debord** expert persona. Debord and the Situationist International developed détournement as their signature technique: "The mutual interference of two worlds of feeling, or the bringing together of two independent expressions, supersedes the original elements and produces a synthetic organization of greater efficacy." Détournement takes the weapons of the spectacle and turns them against it—using advertising against advertising, media against media, the system's own language to expose its contradictions.
